# Bandit Level 18
## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.

## Commands you may need to solve this level
ssh, ls, cat

## Solution
The details of all the shells that are available on a system is stored under /etc/shells . Lets look at the file on our system to get an idea of what are the different shells that could be present on the target (Only on Linux)\
Now that we have an idea of some of the shells that should be preset on all systems we can try logging with them using SSH. The -t flag of the SSH command is used to specify the shell to be used to login into the system.

cat /etc/shells \
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -t "/bin/sh"

## Pass
