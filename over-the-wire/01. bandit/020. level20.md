# Bandit Level 20
## Level Goal
There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

NOTE: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think

## Commands you may need to solve this level
ssh, nc, cat, bash, screen, tmux, Unix ‘job control’ (bg, fg, jobs, &, CTRL-Z, …)

## Solution
We have an binary file that makes connection to user specified port and reads a line of text. If the text is same as the last level password we get next level password.

So the first task that we need to do is setup an listener on any port on the system that will return the previous level password if we connect to that port using the binary file. We can setup an listener using the netcat command.

echo "VxCazJaVykI6W36BkBU0mJTCM8rR95XT" | netcat -lp 1234 & \
jobs \
./suconnect 1234
