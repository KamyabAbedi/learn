# Bandit Level 21
## Level Goal
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

## Commands you may need to solve this level
cron, crontab, crontab(5) (use “man 5 crontab” to access this)

## Solution
ls /etc/cron.d/ \
file ./* \
cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit22

When we look at the cron job for bandit22 we see that there is an shell script that is being executed every second

cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh

When we look at the script we see that it is creating an file called t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv in the /tmp directory and then saving the password for the next level into that file.
