# Bandit Level 25
## Level Goal
Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy… The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

## Commands you may need to solve this level
ssh, cat, more, vi, ls, id, pwd

## Solution
cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26 \
ls -la /usr/bin/showtext\
ssh bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -i bandit26.sshkey\

If we look at the man pages of more we see that by pressing the “v” key while in interactive mode it will open the current line in an editor that is defined by the VISUAL and EDITOR environment variables. If both the variables are not set then Vim will be used. Lets see on pressing “v” which editor we get.
Looking at the output looks like it opened the vim editor. This is great anyone who has used vim knows that vim has an command mode which has the ability to execute system commands. By performing a quick google search we can gather that using the “set shell” command we can change the shell a user and by invoking “shell” the user should be loaded into the specified shell. The “:” operator is used to enter command mode in vim.

v\
:set shell=/bin/bash\
Note : Once this command is entered we will be put in insert mode so press “Esc” to exit inset mode and enter the next command.\
:shell\
 cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26
